# Mattermost Hackathon 2020
#### December 10 (Thursday) - 14 (Monday)

Mattermost is holding a virtual hackathon December 10 - 14! You can work on anything to do with Mattermost for your hackathon submission. Projects ideas include plugins, new server or webapp features, doc improvements, and Mattermost tutorial videos.

## How do I submit my project?

Submit your Hackathon project following these steps:
1. [Create a new file in `hackathon-submissions` folder](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-hackathon-dec2020/new/main/hackathon-submissions). Please use `.md` as the extension of the file.
2. Name the file `<your-github-username>-<your-submission-name>`. For example, `jasonblais-onedrive-plugin`.
3. Include either 
 - a link to a repository containing your project (e.g. an integration or plugin), or
 - a short, 1-2 paragraph description of your work.
4. Submit your changes as a pull request. If other members worked with you on the project, please make sure to include that in your pull request description.
